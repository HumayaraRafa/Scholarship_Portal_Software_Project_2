Most fires are caused by arson and, despite COVID-19 restrictions, this spring has seen the largest area burned in South Wales over the last ten years; larger than that of any other UK region.\r\n\r\nThere is a very limited understanding of the socio-economic drivers for these ignitions as well as of some of the environmental implications of the extensive fires they cause. Many of these fires directly and indirectly affect land and infrastructures managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). The lack of knowledge identified above limits NRW’s ability to effectively tackle the fire problem, which is exacerbated by climate change and reduced grazing of the land.\r\n\r\nThe student will work in collaboration with Natural Resources Wales and will carry out (i) socio-economic interview surveys of representative sectors of the population to better understand the socio-economic causes of arson in the region and (ii) carry out a review of the global literature on socioeconomic, health and biodiversity impacts from wildfire from research in areas with similar habitat types as the South Wales valleys.\r\n\r\nScholarships are collaborative awards with external partners including SMEs and micro companies, as well as public and third sector organisations.
